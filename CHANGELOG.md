- The `gulpfile` has been cleaned up
- The boilerplate should now support more Babel transforms. Because support for these things is always changing, I encourage you to try out the features you wish to use to see if they work. [File an issue](https://github.com/lanetix/generator-lanetix-script/issues/new) if they don't!
- There's a new `npm` script solely for linting: `npm lint`
- Webpack is now the sole build tool. It has replaced Esperanto (which is deprecated) and Browserify
